# In-class Build #4 - Responsive Form
This is a mentored build, thus follow the instructor's instructions/questions during the class block. You **MUST** be present in class to get a grade for this assignment. Being in attendance does not gaurantee you a grade for this assignment.

## Instructions to Finish off the Build
*  Add a checkbox and replace the paragraph "By signing up..." as the label. Research what a checkbox needs and add all the necessary attributes to that input.
*  The first breakpoint happens at 700px, that is when the form input fields go to 2 rows of 2 columns.
*  The second breakpoint happens at 1000px, that is when the form will become 650px wide and the heading and text will be on the left.
*  The last breakpoint happens at 1440px and the section will become fixed width and will not grow.
